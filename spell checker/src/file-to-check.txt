Gardening can be difficult to differentiate from farming. They are most easly differentiated based on their primary objctives.
Farming prioritizes saleable goods and may include livestock production whereas gardening often prioritizes aesthetics and leisure.
As it pertans to food production, gardening genrally happens on a much smaller scale with the intent of personal or community consumption.
It is important to note that there are cultures which do not differentiate between farming and gardening. This is primarily because subsistence
agriculture has been the main method of farming throughout its twelve year history and is virtually indistinguishable from gardening.

My name is Eva and I love having a garden in my yard in Lehi, Utah.
