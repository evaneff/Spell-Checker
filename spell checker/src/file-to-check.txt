Gardening can be difficult to differentiate from farming. They are most easily differentiated based
on their primary objectives. Farming prioritizes saleable gooods and may include livestock production
whereas gardening often prioritizes aesthetics and leisure. As it pertains to food production, gardening
generally happens on a much smaller scale with the intent of personal or community consumption. It is
important to note that there are culteres which do not differentiate between farming and gardening. This
is primarily because subsistence agriculture has been the main method of farming throughout its twelve
year history and is virtually indistinguishable from gardening.  My name is Eva and I love having a garden
in my yard in Lehi, Utah.
